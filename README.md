# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Omar and I have been given a new assignment to analysis the PyBer data to create a summary by city type.  Once we have the summary, we will create a line graph that will summarize how the data differs the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
It is not surprising that cities that categorized as urban had far more rides, but it does appear that rural rides have a higher fare.  This is clearly shown with the table.

It is also not surprising that the weekly fare are also higher in the summer.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Additional data analysis to determine if the fare prices in the rural area is because of the lack of drivers or because of the distance driven.
  a. If it is because of the distance driven, then there is a possible market for green energy rides at a premium.
2. To grow urban and suburban market share, additional drivers will be necessary.
3. As it appears that the summer is a busier season, targeting university students as both drivers and potential customers in an ad campaign would be beneficial.
